# Stripped Chain

## Project Overview
Stripped Chain is a modular blockchain solution designed to securely manage and store various types of data with enhanced scalability and flexibility. By forking the OP Stack, Stripped Chain integrates advanced data handling, encryption, and micropayment functionalities, leveraging Optimismâ€™s robust infrastructure. This provides a versatile framework for a wide range of applications, including document management, financial instruments, supply chain management, and healthcare records.

## Problem Statement
In the current digital landscape, managing and storing data securely and efficiently is a significant challenge. Traditional systems often face issues related to data integrity, scalability, and security. Additionally, running and maintaining blockchain nodes can be resource-intensive and complex. With the increasing need for decentralized solutions, there is a demand for a framework that can handle various data types securely while providing flexibility and scalability without the burden of extensive node management.

## Solution
Stripped Chain addresses these challenges by offering a modular architecture that allows developers to pick and choose the components they need. This approach ensures data security through advanced encryption techniques and data integrity via blockchain verification. By leveraging the Optimism blockchain, Stripped Chain offers a robust and efficient method to verify and roll up data hashes, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

### Key Features:
- **Private or Public Blockchain**: Utilizes 256-bit hashes for private or public blockchain storage and 128-bit hashes for integration with the Optimism blockchain.
- **Data Security**: Implements AES encryption and Merkle tree structures to ensure data is securely encrypted and efficiently verifiable.
- **Modularity**: Allows developers to integrate only the necessary components, providing flexibility and reducing overhead.
- **Scalability**: Leverages the Optimism blockchain for data roll-ups, ensuring efficient data management and scalability without extensive node management.
- **Micropayments**: Integrates smart contracts that handle micropayments, supporting sustainable development and usage.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof-Like Verification**: Facilitates secure data verification by sharing Merkle roots and encrypted file locations.

By combining these features, Stripped Chain aims to provide a comprehensive and flexible solution for secure data management and storage in various applications and industries.
